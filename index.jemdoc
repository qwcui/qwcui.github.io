== About me
I am currently a first year Ph.D. student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at University of Washington. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor
 [https://simonshaoleidu.com Simon Shaolei Du]. My research interests are boardly in machine learning theory. I have been working on reinforcement learning theory and I am also exploring other areas like optimization and game theory.

Prior to starting my Ph.D. study, I did my undergrad in the [https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/en/ School of Mathematical Sciences] at [https://english.pku.edu.cn Peking University] advised by Professor
[https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/ Zaiwen Wen]. I had a great summer working with Professor [http://drlinyang.net Lin F. Yang] in 2020, who led me into the world of reinforcement learning theory.

== Research
My research interests include 
- Reinforcement Learning
- Optimization 
- Game Theory
