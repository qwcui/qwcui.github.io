== About me
I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [https://simonshaoleidu.com Simon Shaolei Du]. Prior to starting my Ph.D. study, I did my undergrad in the [https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/en/ School of Mathematical Sciences] at [https://english.pku.edu.cn Peking University] advised by Professor
[https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/ Zaiwen Wen]. I had a great summer working with Professor [http://drlinyang.net Lin F. Yang] in 2020, who led me into the world of reinforcement learning theory.


My research interests are in reinforcement learning. I have been working on designing provably efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for the offline case (exploiting the dataset) and the online case (exploring the structured environment). I have also done research in optimization and game theory. I am also interested in the role of RL(HF) in the performance of LLMs.
